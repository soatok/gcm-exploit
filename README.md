# AES-GCM Invisible Salamanders Exploit Proof-of-Concept (PHP)

Usage: `php generate.php` to generate a ciphertext + tag payload that can be decrypted by two distinct
keys.

Change the constants `PLAIN_A` and `PLAIN_B` in `generate.php` to whatever you desire. They **MUST** both
be even multiples of 16 bytes long.

Created for the DEFCON Furs.
